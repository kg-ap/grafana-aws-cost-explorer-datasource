# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Authenticate with the AWS SDK credential chain, so a Grafana server that
  already holds an AWS identity needs no stored access key.

## 1.0.8 (2026-09-19)

- First signed release. Enable plugin signing in the release workflow using a
  Grafana Cloud access policy token. No functional changes since 1.0.7.

## 1.0.7 (2026-09-09)

- Rename an internal validation label to clear two false-positive gosec G101
  "hardcoded credentials" findings.
- Raise the Go toolchain to 1.26.8, resolving eight standard-library
  vulnerabilities reported by govulncheck.
- Update `@grafana/plugin-e2e` to 3.12.0 for compatibility with the Grafana
  13.2+ panel editor.
- Bump `google.golang.org/grpc` to 1.83.2 and pin `fast-uri` and `js-yaml`
  to patched versions, clearing HIGH advisories reported by the plugin
  validator's vulnerability scan.

## 1.0.6 (2026-08-20)

- Remove the AWS SDK default credential-chain authentication mode.
- Require explicitly configured source credentials for AssumeRole.
- Return generic health-check failures to the browser while retaining
  diagnostic errors in backend logs.
- Update vulnerable transitive frontend dependencies.

## 1.0.0 (Unreleased)

- Add AWS SDK v2 default, AssumeRole, and secure static authentication.
- Add Cost Explorer health checks and paginated `GetCostAndUsage` queries.
- Add the visual metric, granularity, grouping, filtering, and format editor.
- Add native Grafana time-series and table frames.
- Add bounded TTL/LRU caching with in-flight request deduplication.
- Add mocked backend/frontend tests, provisioning, example dashboard, CI, and
  security documentation.

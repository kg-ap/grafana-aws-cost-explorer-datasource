# AWS Cost Explorer for Grafana

> Query AWS Cost Explorer directly from Grafana in minutes, with a visual
> query builder and intelligent caching—without building a CUR/Athena pipeline
> or manually signing API requests.

AWS Cost Explorer for Grafana is an open-source backend data-source plugin for
self-hosted Grafana. It turns dashboard time ranges and visual query controls
into signed AWS Cost Explorer `GetCostAndUsage` requests, then returns native
Grafana time-series or table data frames.

The temporary plugin ID is `ivlabsdev-awscostexplorer-datasource`. The source
repository lives under the GitHub organization `ivlabs-dev`; Grafana's official
scaffolder normalizes that organization name to the ID prefix `ivlabsdev`.

This is an independent community project. It is not created, sponsored, or

## Requirements

- Grafana 12.3 or later
- Node.js 22 or 24 for frontend development
- npm 11
- Go 1.26.5, as selected by the current Grafana scaffold
- Mage for backend builds
- Docker and Docker Compose for the local Grafana environment
- an AWS identity with `ce:GetCostAndUsage`
- Cost Explorer enabled in the AWS payer/management account being queried

The Go command can automatically download the toolchain declared in `go.mod`
when `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto` is enabled.

## Quick start

Install dependencies and build both halves of the plugin:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
mage -v
```

Start the standard local Grafana environment:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>, sign in as the development administrator, open
**Connections > Data sources > AWS Cost Explorer**, and select **Save & test**.
The development container explicitly allows this unsigned plugin. Restart
Grafana after changing `src/plugin.json`.

The provisioned development data source copies AWS environment variables into
Grafana `secureJsonData`. Export `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`,
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and optional `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` before starting
Compose. Do not commit those values.

## Installation

For a development install, use the provided Compose environment. For a manual
Grafana install:

1. Build or download an artifact for the Grafana server architecture.
2. Extract its top-level `ivlabsdev-awscostexplorer-datasource` directory into
   Grafana's plugin directory.
3. Ensure the `gpx_*` backend binary is executable.
4. Install a properly signed release, or explicitly allow the plugin ID only in
   a non-production development Grafana configuration.
5. Restart Grafana.

Grafana's official packaging flow is:

```bash
npm run build
mage -v
mv dist ivlabsdev-awscostexplorer-datasource
zip -r ivlabsdev-awscostexplorer-datasource-1.0.0.zip \
  ivlabsdev-awscostexplorer-datasource
```

Use a temporary copy of `dist` when packaging locally so the development mount
is not renamed. Signing requires a Grafana access-policy token:

```bash
GRAFANA_ACCESS_POLICY_TOKEN=... npm run sign
```

No signing credential is required by ordinary CI or unit tests.

## Data-source configuration

An **Authentication Provider** supplies credentials, and an optional **Assume
Role ARN** layers a role on top of whichever provider you chose.

### Authentication Provider

#### AWS SDK Default

Resolves the AWS SDK credential chain — an EC2 instance profile, an ECS task
role, or EKS web identity. Nothing is stored on the data source; attach the
policy below to the role the Grafana server already runs as.

#### Access & secret key

Takes an access key ID, a secret access key, and an optional session token. It
installs an explicit credentials provider and refuses to start without a key,
so it never falls back to an ambient identity.

All credential values are written to Grafana `secureJsonData`. Grafana encrypts
them at rest and returns only configured/not-configured flags to the browser
after saving. The backend receives decrypted values only when Grafana creates
the data-source instance. They are never logged or placed in query models or
cache keys.

### Assume Role ARN

Optional, and independent of the provider: the selected provider is used to
assume the role rather than to query Cost Explorer directly, so an instance
profile can assume a cross-account role just as an access key can. An external
ID and role session name may be given alongside it, and the external ID is
stored as a secret.

The resolved identity needs `sts:AssumeRole` on the target role, and that
role's trust policy must trust it.

### Upgrading

Data sources saved as `static` or `assumeRole` keep working: both are read as
the `keys` provider, and `assumeRole` carries its role ARN across. Any other
stored `authMode` is not translated and has to be reconfigured.

## IAM policy

The target AWS identity needs only this MVP action:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "ReadCostExplorer",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ce:GetCostAndUsage",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Cost Explorer does not provide a resource ARN for this operation, so
`Resource` must be `"*"`. The plugin does not need or request AWS write access.
An identity that assumes a role additionally requires `sts:AssumeRole` for that
specific target role; that permission belongs in the source policy, not this
target role policy.

The same policy is available at
[`docs/iam-policy.json`](docs/iam-policy.json).

## Query examples

The query editor uses the Grafana dashboard range automatically.

- Total daily cost: **Unblended cost**, **Daily**, no grouping, **Time series**
- Daily cost by service: **Unblended cost**, **Daily**, group by **AWS
  service**, **Top 10**, combine remaining groups as **Other**, **Time series**
- Account/service matrix: group first by **Linked account**, then by **AWS
  service**, **Table**
- Monthly effective cost: **Amortized cost**, **Monthly**, no grouping,
  **Align to complete calendar months**, **Table**
- Tagged workload: set tag key `Environment` and tag value `production`

Cost Explorer's end date is exclusive. The backend preserves a dashboard end
at exact UTC midnight and rounds any other end timestamp to the next UTC date.

`UsageQuantity` can combine unrelated units such as hours and gigabytes.
Filter to a meaningful service or usage type before using it.

### Period and presentation semantics

AWS may revise the current day or month while billing data is still arriving.
The plugin therefore excludes the current UTC billing period by default:

- daily queries stop before the current UTC calendar day
- monthly queries stop before the current UTC calendar month
- a range containing no completed periods returns an empty, valid frame with a
  notice and makes no AWS request

Select **Include incomplete current period** when intentionally viewing
month-to-date or current-day data. The frame metadata then records that the
response may contain an incomplete period. This option affects only the Cost
Explorer query; it does not alter the dashboard time range.

Monthly queries select **Align to complete calendar months** by default. The
start is normalized to the first day of its month, and the exclusive end uses
a calendar-month boundary. Disabling alignment preserves the range-derived
behavior and can return a partial first or last month.

Table periods are sortable strings: `YYYY-MM-DD` for daily data and `YYYY-MM`
for monthly data. Time-series values remain Grafana timestamps at the beginning
of the AWS billing period in UTC; the plugin never applies a browser-local
offset.

Grouped time-series display names contain values only, such as `Amazon EC2` or
`Amazon EC2 · Production`. Dimension names and values remain available as
Grafana field labels. Top N ranking uses each group's decimal-safe total across
the complete returned range. When enabled, `Other` sums the excluded groups
separately for every period and never combines incompatible units.

### Example dashboard KPIs

The provisioned dashboard places four stat panels above the detailed charts:

- **Cost in selected period** sums ungrouped `UnblendedCost`.
- **Month-to-date cost** intentionally includes the incomplete current period
  and notes AWS reporting delay.
- **Change vs previous period** compares the selected range with the immediately
  preceding equivalent-duration range. Positive and negative changes are
  presented neutrally; a zero previous total returns no percentage.
- **Highest-cost service** ranks services over the selected range and displays
  the leading service name without a `SERVICE=` prefix.

## Caching behavior

Cost Explorer API requests can incur AWS charges. Caching is therefore part of
the query path:

- default TTL: 900 seconds
- default capacity: 256 entries per configured Grafana data source
- bounded LRU eviction
- failures are never cached
- identical concurrent misses share one AWS request
- cache entries are local to one backend process and are not shared by Grafana
  replicas

Keys are SHA-256 digests of safe credential context and the canonical request:
role ARN, authentication mode, region, time period, granularity, metric,
groupings, and filters. Secrets are excluded. Filter and tag values influence
the digest but are not emitted in logs. Presentation-only choices such as table
versus time series, Top N, and `Other` reuse the same cached AWS response.

Every returned frame carries a `costExplorer` custom metadata object. Grafana's
Query Inspector can show:

- query execution timestamp, total backend duration, and AWS API duration
- cache status (`hit`, `miss`, or `bypass`), hit age, and configured TTL
- AWS page count
- whether an incomplete billing period was included
- whether AWS marked any returned period as estimated

Cache hits report zero AWS duration and zero pages because no AWS call was made
for that execution. Metadata never contains credentials, external IDs, cache
keys, request filters, or tag values.

## What the plugin sends to AWS

The backend sends signed HTTPS `GetCostAndUsage` requests containing the
selected period, metric, granularity, group definitions, optional filters, and
pagination token. AssumeRole mode also sends the configured role ARN, session
name, and optional external ID to AWS STS. It sends no Grafana user data,
dashboard titles, panel titles, analytics, or tracking events.

## Development commands

```bash
# Install locked frontend dependencies
npm ci

# Frontend watch/production builds
npm run dev
npm run build

# Frontend checks
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test:ci

# Backend formatting check, analysis, tests, and builds
test -z "$(gofmt -l ./pkg)"
go vet ./pkg/...
go test ./pkg/...
mage -v

# Local Grafana
docker compose up --build

# Playwright smoke tests (Grafana must be running)
npm exec playwright install chromium
npm run e2e
```

The real AWS Playwright health test is disabled by default:

```bash
AWS_INTEGRATION_TEST=1 npm run e2e
```

Only opt in with disposable/role credentials and the least-privilege policy.

## Troubleshooting

**No AWS credentials were found**

Configure an access key ID and secret access key in the data-source settings.
For AssumeRole, configure the source credentials used to authenticate the STS
request. Environment variables and workload credentials are not read directly
by the plugin.

**AWS denied the request**

Grant `ce:GetCostAndUsage` to the final identity. In AssumeRole mode, also
verify the source `sts:AssumeRole` policy, target trust policy, external ID, and
role ARN.

**The query is empty**

Cost Explorer must be enabled, billing data can lag, and filters require exact
Cost Explorer dimension values. Widen the dashboard range and remove filters
to isolate the issue.

**The latest day is missing**

This is the safe default. Daily queries exclude the current UTC calendar day
because AWS can still revise it. Enable **Include incomplete current period**
when the partial value is useful.

**The latest month is missing**

Monthly queries exclude the current calendar month by default. Enable
**Include incomplete current period** for month-to-date reporting. The example
month-to-date KPI already does this intentionally.

**Why does the current month not match my AWS console yet?**

Cost Explorer is not real-time, its results may be estimated, and AWS can revise
recent periods. The plugin also uses a bounded cache. Check
`costExplorer.containsEstimatedData`, `cacheStatus`, `cacheAgeSeconds`, and
`queryExecutedAt` in Query Inspector before comparing snapshots.

**Why does the dashboard show cached data?**

The default cache TTL is 15 minutes to avoid unnecessary paid Cost Explorer API
calls. Query Inspector reports the cache status, age, and TTL. Save a shorter
TTL in data-source settings when the additional AWS calls are acceptable;
restarting the backend process also clears this in-memory cache.

**Why are only the top services displayed?**

The example service chart uses Top 10 across the complete selected range and
combines the remainder into `Other` per period. Choose **All** in **Limit
groups**, select a larger limit, or disable **Combine remaining groups as
Other** for a different presentation.

**The plugin is not visible**

Confirm the extracted directory and `plugin.json` both use
`ivlabsdev-awscostexplorer-datasource`, the backend binary is executable, the
plugin is signed or explicitly allowed for development, and Grafana was
restarted after metadata changes.

## Security considerations

- Prefer workload or IAM roles and short-lived credentials.
- Give the final identity only `ce:GetCostAndUsage`.
- Restrict `sts:AssumeRole` to the intended target role.
- Treat Grafana administrators and the Grafana host as privileged because the
  backend receives decrypted secure settings.
- Do not enable debug logging from the AWS SDK with request bodies or signed
  headers in production.
- Protect cost data as potentially sensitive business information.
- Review provisioning files before publishing them; never commit credentials.

The plugin logs safe operational metadata only. It does not log credential
objects, keys, session tokens, full AWS requests, signed headers, or filter/tag
values.

## Current limitations

- in-memory cache only; replicas do not share cache state
- exact text filter entry rather than AWS dimension-value discovery
- no hourly granularity
- no cost category grouping or UI
- highest-cost service uses the service name as its primary stat; portable
  Grafana stat configuration does not also render the cost as secondary text
- no CUR, Athena, forecasts, budgets, anomalies, commitments, or Organizations
  discovery
- no hosted service, reports, notifications, billing, subscriptions, or user
  analytics
- no signed catalog release yet

## Roadmap

Near-term priorities are AWS dimension-value autocomplete, stronger dashboard
and plugin-e2e coverage, and catalog signing/release automation. Later
open-source extensions may add forecasts, cost categories, and optional
distributed caching. CUR/Athena and any managed FinOps service will be designed
as separate capabilities so they do not complicate the direct Cost Explorer
experience.
